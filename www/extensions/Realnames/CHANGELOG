== 0.3.1 (2011-12-25) ==

bugfix:
* custom namespace regex (thanks Cweiske)
* STRICT error with STATIC (thanks Vgold)

notes:
* removed contrib-agreement, consensus in discussions indicate it's
 uneeded to remain BSD in shared environment.
* some progress is being made into core-features for name display, expect
 some future version to support things like sorting based on realnames (thanks Daniel Friesen)
* version 0.3 misreported version as 0.2.1, now 0.3.1 (oops, again)

issues:
* Consensus is that performance could be an issue using current methods. I am currently working
 on a 2-pass version of the extension to address these issues that will be released as soon as
 it is ready.

testing:
* svn trunk 2011-12-26, stable 1.18.0, 1.17.1, 1.16.5, 1.15.5

== 0.3 (2011-11-05) ==

features:
* you can opt-out of replacements using $wgRealnamesReplacements (thanks Salquint)
* we now have smarts in the form of not displaying "Marry - Marry" text
* you can change "smart" features like above using $wgRealnamesSmart

bugfix:
* version 0.2 misreported version as 0.1.1, now 0.3
* now tied into main debugging framework
* a missing return statement was causing titles in append style to get garbled

notes:
* switched to a more permissive and correct bsd-2-clause license agreement for commits
* added more metadata files

issues:
* I continue to be concerned with performance on large recentchanges/history since my initial
 post about it on 2011-09-19. After receiving a few code reviews recently (finally!) the main
 feedback has been that there may indeed be scalability problems with using newFromName. In my
 original post (see extension talk page) I proposed two solutions, but haven't heard from anyone
 experiencing problems yet. I think I may implement a two-pass as described in the next feature
 version, however it will make the code significantly more complex. I'll hold off on extending
 those two specific pages until it's confirmed a two-pass isn't enough.

testing:
* svn trunk 2011-11-05, 1.18.0beta1, 1.17.0, 1.16.5, 1.15.5
